# Lotus-Project
A scholarship Management System
The system aims to help the Lotus Education Trust manage its student Beneficiary information in an automated manner, so they will have to abandon the manual Excel way of doing things.
Its main aim is to help in performing the following actions:
1. perform the CRUD Operations on student, Employee, and Donor Data.
2. Only be an in-house web application for the allowed users such as the Donor, Student, and Finance.
3. Automated the profiling process of the students in that Donor can view their student's profiles from their system Donor accounts.
4. Allow Donors to be able to view their financial contributions and how their fee contributions are being made from the system.
